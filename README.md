## Getting Started

To get started with the project in your local development environment, follow
these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
https://github.com/Nwaigba66/Edusoft-website---FrontEnd.git
```

2. Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor, install the required
   dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install node.js
```

Followed by 
```bash
npm install 
```

3. System Requirements:

Node.js 16.14 or later.
macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.



4. Start the development server by running the following command:

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

## Terminal:
npx create-next-app@latest

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*

After the prompts, create-next-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual Installation
To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

Terminal

npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
Open your package.json file and add the following scripts:

package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

dev: runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode.
build: runs next build to build the application for production usage.
start: runs next start to start a Next.js production server.
lint: runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.

## Usage:
- The application can used on any andriod device because it responsive to any screen size
- It supports any desktop device also

## Good to know:

Next.js now ships with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS configuration by default.
You can optionally use a src directory in the root of your project to separate your application's code from configuration files.

You are now ready to go!
